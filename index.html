<h1>Welcome to my Page!</h1>

<body>As you may not know, I am coding this page using
    HTML. My name is Hussain, I am experinced in programming 
    in the language Python and currently learning the Basics
    of the World Wide Web (HTML)
</body>

<h4>So what is HTML?</h4>


<text>HTML is a very world wide known programming language.
    Every single website, even if programmed with a diffrent
    programming language before is set to be on HTML as this 
    is what all browsers support and all internet websites
    use. You can even find it your self! Go to your browser
    and go to any website. When doing that, you can click
    on Inspect Element > Sources and click on the file. 
    It will always start with HTML in it. There are also
    something called "Cookies" in website and are very
    dangerous if shared with other people. You may go onto a 
    website and it probably has asked you "Do you accept
    cookies" Well, this is used to keep user information
    stored. For an example, you may be on Roblox. It asks
    you for you cookies and you accept. When you Sign In
    to Roblox, those cookies are generated for you. And,
    IF ANYONE ASKS FOR YOU COOKIES SAY NO! Why? You may be
    asking, well I have kind of been in a situation. In October
    of this year (2022) I was just doing my buisness and then
    wanted to go play some Roblox, until... it said my
    password was changed. I didn't think much of it
    as I had 2 Step Verifcation enabled where it sends
    an email to you if you sign in, and there is a code
    in the email and you must put it in so you can 
    log in succesfully. A couple of days went past, and the 
    password wasn't working, so that was it. I contacted
    Roblox Support and they got it backed but I logged on
    and went from 1,000+ Robux to 38 ROBUX! I was absouletly
    shocked, I have never seen such a thing and spent
    a lot of REAL LIFE money on this game. I got it back
    thankfully but the hackers still got the robux! It was
    because Roblox can't change someone's robux even with
    evidence provided. Anyways, I then went onto Inspect
    Element > Cookies > Copy and Pasted into a diffrent 
    browser and boom. I was logged out from my browser
    and logged in the new one without any 2 Step Verifcation,
    No Password and No Email. I don't know how my cookies
    got stolen, but I think it was a virus on my
    computer. So then I learnt to keep your cookies
    safe, or you could lose real life money just
    like I did, AND EVEN IN A GAME...
